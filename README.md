The program I wrote creates a new raw image in the “lib” -folder, “imputedDenoise.raw” with the specified errors fixed.
My time ran short while working, so I had to forget about creating a GUI, which I was hoping to do as well. I was also new to using Gradle, and have only worked with Maven, so I hope that the project is in some satisfactory state.
The largest problem I encountered was manipulating the bytes in the functions, but in the end, I managed to get an image that had no noticeable pixels that were present in the originals.
There is much to improve in the code, since time restraints made me work hastily, so commenting and coherent code might be lacking.
I appreciate all feedback and criticism in order to learn and grow as a developer.

### Path to the java file containing main.java: PlanmecaWorktestGradle\lib\src\main\java\main.java
### Path to resources with the three raw images: PlanmecaWorktestGradle\lib\src\main\resources
